* Rationale

During my undergraduate years, I remember having trouble setting up a postfix server for a
practical exercise in one of my classes. I had to edit the default configuration
file to harden the security of the system. My server was wrongly configured and
I couldn't figure out what part of my edits I had messed up. We had to do all
the changes to configuration file through a tty in an FreeBDS virtual machine,
so I was forced to use a terminal editor. =nano= was my choice since it was
similar to the other GUI editors I had used at the time. After much frustration,
I asked a professor of mine to please help me out. He took over my seat, closed
my =nano= session and reopened the conf file with a different editor. He was
pressing all sorts of keys on the keyboard at an amazing speed, the cursor was
flying all over the screen and I was simply at awe.

He found what was wrong with my config and fixed it, telling me what he had
changed. When he left, I tried to look up what command he had run to edit the
file. This was my first experience with... =vim=.  I was introduced to =emacs= a
few months later, when I saw a friend of mine taking some notes with it.

In any case, this is the earliest point that I can remember thinking that the
efficiency of text-editing, just like with any other task, is fully dependent on
the tool used to achieve it. Considering that I was on a professional path to
become a software engineer, a job that mostly consists of reading documentation,
source code and editing, I figured that it would pay off in the long run to take
some time to explore what editors were out there and make an educated choice for
a text editor, instead of just using whatever was popular.

** ~(message "Hello, %s!" "emacs")~

Having taken that decision, I played around with =vim= and later on with
=emacs=, finally settling with the former to write the code for my thesis. I
started out with a vanilla configuration, a single =.emacs= file where I would
copy and paste elisp from other people's config without much thinking.  It was
ugly, messy and buggy but It was also very fun. I loved the idea of using code to
configure the tool that I would use to edit code, so I stuck with it.

My knowledge of emacs would come from google searches, blog posts and the online
GNU Emacs documentation. I still hadn't learned how to ask emacs the things that
I didn't know (The invaluable C-h _).  Embarrasingly, I didn't learn that until
fairly late into my emacs usage history.  My editing needs were quite minimal so
even if my configuration didn't have all the bells and whistles of other
editors, It was good enough for me. I also knew, at least on a theoretical
level, that emacs had very few limits when it came to extensibility. Emacs can
interact with the OS to do just about anything, which explains part of the
popular saying that refers to emacs as "A great OS, if only missing a good text
editor".

When I got frustrated with emacs because I broke it somehow or I didn't know how
to do something with it, the potential of emacs as an almost infinitely
extensible editor always kept me from switching editors and moving on. Even now,
is this fact that keeps me going back to it.

** Distro-hopping with emacs distros

Life changes and so do our needs. I got my first full-time job as Web Developer
and emacs had to level up to a robust daily driver. I had to use many different
technologies in a project with continuously changing requirements.  My cute
emacs experiment could not keep up and I was forced on using other editors to be
able to push the work out.  However, I was always missing aspects of emacs when
using  other editors, like the frame, buffer and window model, the automatic
backup files or just the simple fact that I could change almost any aspect of my
emacs if I so desired.

I would still open up emacs for magit when interacting with git or for org-mode
as my todo app. However, I wanted to use emacs for more than that. Emacs shines
when you know what you want from it. However, It can be very daunting and take a
lot of work to set up a configuration for "general" programming purposes.  Which
packages are good? Which are compatible with what you have? When two or more
packages are similar, how do you decide which one to use? If emacs was to be my
daily driver, I would have to answer this questions often, which implies
research, time and effort.

_Why work on problems that others have already solved?_ With this in mind, I
decided to try out =spacemacs=, a community developed emacs distribution full of
pre-configured packages grouped by =layers=. And for a while, It worked out
great. The defaults were good, it was functional enough and it could keep up
with the technologies I was using at work. What was not to love? Well, with
continuous use the wrinkles started to appear. For one, =spacemacs= was slow. It
would take a long time to startup and commands were noticeably sluggish. It was
also pretty buggy.  Sure, the layers for different languages worked reasonably
well but from time to time emacs would behave in unexpected ways and I would
have no idea why.

Looking into ways of making =spacemacs= faster, I stumbled upon =doom= and
decided to try it out. I was impressed (and I still am) with its speed, at
startup and during use, it feels quick and snappy. Installing =doom= modules was
similar enough to configuring =spacemacs= layers. While =doom= was not
by any means buggy, I would get frustrated with it's opinionated defaults.
=doom= would have some keybinding I didn't like or some package had some extra
behaviour different to what I was used to and I wouldn't know how to change it
to what I wanted.

** Back to vanilla.

At this point it was clear to me what was the real problem. My ignorance of the
inner workings on emacs was my only limiting factor. So I took an extreme
position, I went back to pure vanilla again, discarding all my previous
configurations and starting from scratch, while using other editors for my job.
My objective was to recreate the aspects that I liked from =doom= from scratch
in my own configuration. Very naive, but I was motivated.

I took it slow, researching Emacs throughly and little by little building my
configuration, but trying to understand everything that I was chaging. I read
[[https://www.masteringemacs.org/][Mickey Peterson's Mastering Emacs]], where I finally learned how to ask emacs about the
things I don't understand. I found the excellent [[http://ergoemacs.org/][Xah's ergoemacs]] blog, an
awesome reference I keep consulting even now with all sorts of information on
elisp syntax, emacs concepts and configuration tips and tricks.

I started following members of the awesome emacs community, such as
[[https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs/][Protesilaos Stavrou]], a long term =vim= user transformed into a hardcore emacs user, whose
videos explaining his configuration where a great inspiration for me and taught
me to favour built-in packages over third party packages and most importantly,
how to build my own criteria for what packages I should use.

It took at least two months until I made a configuration that I could use at
work again, but it felt great when I finally managed to have something
that was reasonably fast, reproducible in any computer running linux and was
functional enough for my use cases that I had made and I intimately understood!
Although I am nowhere near a emacs expert, if such a thing exists, and a lot of
details still escape me. I learned a LOT about not only emacs, but about
lisp, functional programming and free (as in freedom) extensible software! Going
back to basics paid of in spades.

** Why DOOM?

I'll ask again, _Why work on problems that others have already solved?_. Well,
in my case, It was to learn more about the problem-context.  The thing is, emacs
is truly immense, even if we don't take into account all the third party
packages written for it. It has it's own lisp dialect for extensibility, a
=mode= system for defining unique behaviour in each buffer, with =major modes=
(one per buffer) and =minor modes= (can be multiple or none in a buffer) that
change the visual elements, available commands and keybindings and it has different
systems to detect when and which of this modes it should activate at any given
time. It also has different ways of running system commands synchronously or
asynchronously and processing their output. It even has a process manager for the
programs running under emacs!

I'm not even being exaustive. Add to that 40 years of packages and multiple
emacs releases! This wouldn't be so troublesome if it weren't for the terrible
defaults with which emacs installs. Ugly default theme and questionable default
bindings aside, it is terribly unoptimized for modern systems slowing down
performance. During my vanilla adventure, a lot of my time was just spent trying
to make emacs feel more modern and fast, which is very time consuming.  As a bit
of tangent, I am suprised that packages such as gchm and use-package don't come
preinstalled with emacs as they are incredible time savers, not just with
performance but also in configuration time...

At the beginning of reconfiguring my vanilla emacs, after addressing the
terrible defaults, the problems I was trying to solve were interesting, perhaps
because it was my first time trying to solve them. Things like "What's the best
moment to lazy load this package?", "How do I write Spanish accents in emacs?"
or "How should I structure my .el files directory?". As the configuration grew,
more and more problems started appearing. Nothing major that broke my workflow
but annoyances none the less. I would write =FIXME= comments in my .el files to
keep track of this problems so I could fix them later.

When I wanted to set up emacs for a new language environments, I would spend a
lot of time checking out what community packages there were for that especific
environment, putting =TODO= comments with the projects repository url so I could
try out and configure it out later on. Quickly It became the case that for every =FIXME=
or =TODO= comment I would solve, two or three more would appear.

The =FIXME= were not such a big deal, I like hunting bugs and fixing them, since
I always feel like I atleast learn something in the process.  The big problems
were the =TODO=, which were not remotly as interesting to solve. Looking for
packages is time consuming and many times I ended up not using what I tried out.
Other times, the packages I was interested in were so massive I never wanted to
because I knew It would take a long time to really configure it like I wanted
to. Honorable mentions in this categories are =lsp= and =treemacs=.

#+HTML: <p align="center"><img src="img/too-many-todos.png"/></p>
#+HTML: <p align="center">Unresolved issues in my vanilla configuration.</p>

So, _Why work on problems that others have already solved?_. Not all problems
are made equally and some problems are just tedious to solve, this is the
principal reason why I choose to go back to =doom=. Another reason is that I
strongly agree with the project guiding principals. =doom= is not and IDE
replacement or a you get what you see type of editor. It's fully expected of its
users to customize it and all its functionality is opened to the user so it can
be tinkered with. No magic, just very well thought out elisp macros and hooks!

This is perhaps what I like the most about =doom=, its true power resides in
it's =core= module, where all the macros, functions and hooks used to help the
user extend emacs resides. The =modules= in =doom= just use those set of tools
to offer configuration options for specific use cases. This offers a mix of the
best of both the worlds of vanilla emacs and spacemacs. With =doom= I can try
out a module, see what I like, bring it over to my configuration, disable
packages that I don't like and mix them with my own packages in a quick and
reliable manner, much more so that If I were back in vanilla emacs.

** TL;DR:

[[https://blog.jethro.dev/posts/migrating_to_doom_emacs/][It offers reasonable defaults and lots of functionality without sacrificing extensability or performance]]

* Installation

** Prerequisites

- Git 2.23+
- Emacs 26.1+ *(27.x is recommended)*
- [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][ripgrep]] 11.0+
- GNU Find
- (Optional) [[https://github.com/sharkdp/fd][fd]] 7.3.0+ (known as ~fd-find~ on Debian, Ubuntu & derivatives) --
  improves performance for many file indexing commands

Additionally, the =doom= executable (located at ~user-emacs-directory/bin/doom~)
can be called with the =doctor= argument to obtain information of posible
missing dependencies used in the modules.

* Configuration

Blocks preceded with =IE= are just examples that are not evaluated, the rest of
the blocks are put in the filename of the corresponding heading.

** init.el

This file controls what Doom modules are enabled and what order they load
in. Remember to run ~doom sync~ after modifying it!

*** Lexical binding.

Elisp by default has dynamic-scope, which is fine if a little weird. However,
dynamic scope comes with a performence penalty. Optional lexical scope has to be
activated with a file parameter, as such:

#+begin_src elisp :tangle init.el
;;; init.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
#+end_src

*** doom!

The ~doom!~ macro controls which modules are loaded into doom emacs. Modules are
package configurations made by the community. In the spirit of emacs, all the
configuration that comes with a particular module can be extended or even completly
overwritten by your private config.

Modules are completly open for discovery.Press 'SPC h d h' (or 'C-h d h' for
non-vim users) to access Doom's documentation. There you'll find a "Module
Index" link where you'll find a comprehensive list of Doom's modules and what
flags they support.

Alternatively, press 'gd' (or 'C-c c d') on a module to browse its directory
(for easy access to its source code).

The ~doom!~ macro is capable of some conditional logic, thanks to the ~:if~ and
~:cond~ keywords.  Unfortunately, these keywords are not well documented beyond
and example in the docs. The rest of the keywords match with a directory location.
The symbols following a keyword are a module that reside in said directory.

A module is structurely similar to the ~$DOODIR~ folder. Defines a package.el
and config.el in the very least, plus autoloads and such. Some modules are
documented with a ~README.org~, many others are not, so it's important to take a
look a the source code, see what they define and configure, before deciding to
use a module.

Some modules can be wrapped in a list and given 'flags', that activate extra
optional configuration. The list must have the module name as the car, the flags
as the tail.

**** TODO Document which modules I choose and why.

For brevity sake I'll mostly comment on the modules I am using, giving some insight
on why I choose them and the dependencies needed to make them work. Ocassionally, I
may comment on modules that I might try.

** package.el
*** Lexical binding

Been there, done that...

#+begin_src elisp :tangle packages.el
;; -*- no-byte-compile: t; -*-
;;; $DOOMDIR/packages.el
#+end_src

*** How does package.el work?

To install a package with Doom you must declare them here and run ~doom sync~
on the command line, then restart Emacs for the changes to take effect -- or
use ~M-x doom/reload~.

To install SOME-PACKAGE from MELPA, ELPA or emacsmirror:

IE:
#+begin_src elisp :tangle no
(package! some-package)
#+end_src

To install a package directly from a remote git repo, you must specify a
~:recipe~. You'll find documentation on what ~:recipe~ accepts here:
https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#the-recipe-format

IE:
#+begin_src elisp :tangle no
(package! another-package
  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"))
#+end_src

If the package you are trying to install does not contain a PACKAGENAME.el
file, or is located in a subdirectory of the repo, you'll need to specify
~:files~ in the ~:recipe~:

IE:
#+begin_src elisp :tangle no
(package! this-package
  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"
           :files ("some-file.el" "src/lisp/*.el")))   
#+end_src

If you'd like to disable a package included with Doom, you can do so here
with the ~:disable~ property:

IE:
#+begin_src elisp :tangle no
(package! builtin-package :disable t)
#+end_src

You can override the recipe of a built in package without having to specify
all the properties for ~:recipe~. These will inherit the rest of its recipe
from Doom or MELPA/ELPA/Emacsmirror:

IE:
#+begin_src elisp :tangle no
(package! builtin-package :disable t)
#+end_src

You can override the recipe of a built in package without having to specify
all the properties for ~:recipe~. These will inherit the rest of its recipe
from Doom or MELPA/ELPA/Emacsmirror:

IE:
#+begin_src elisp :tangle no
(package! builtin-package :recipe (:nonrecursive t))
(package! builtin-package-2 :recipe (:repo "myfork/package"))
#+end_src

Specify a ~:branch~ to install a package from a particular branch or tag.
This is required for some packages whose default branch isn't ~master~ (which
our package manager can't deal with; see raxod502/straight.el#279)

IE:
#+begin_src elisp :tangle no
(package! builtin-package :recipe (:branch "develop"))
#+end_src

Use ~:pin~ to specify a particular commit to install.
IE:
#+begin_src elisp :tangle no
(package! builtin-package :pin "1a2b3c4d5e")
#+end_src

Doom's packages are pinned to a specific commit and updated from release to
release. The ~unpin!~ macro allows you to unpin single packages...

IE:
#+begin_src elisp :tangle no
(unpin! pinned-package)
; ...or multiple packages
(unpin! pinned-package another-pinned-package)
; ...Or *all* packages (NOT RECOMMENDED; will likely break things)
(unpin! t)
#+end_src

*** Declarations

So, finally, let's declare the packages we will use:

#+begin_src elisp :tangle packages.el
(package! org-edna)
(package! mozc)
(package! nvm)
; TODO https://github.com/dalanicolai/pdf-continuous-scroll-mode.el/blob/master/pdf-continuous-scroll-mode.el Look into this.
#+end_src

And disable ones we don't use.
#+begin_src elisp :tangle packages.el
(package! ddskk ;; MOZC is better, consider contributing it to the japanese module.
  :disable t)
#+end_src

** config.el
*** Lexical binding

Third time is the charm...

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;;; $DOOMDIR/config.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
#+END_SRC

*** Personal information

Some functionality uses this to identify you, e.g. GPG configuration, email
clients, file templates and snippets.

#+begin_src elisp
(setq user-full-name "Daniel Levy Moreno"
      user-mail-address "daniellevymoreno@gmail.com")
#+end_src

*** Default font

Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom. Here
are the three important ones:

+ ~doom-font~
+ ~doom-variable-pitch-font~
+ ~doom-big-font~ -- used for ~doom-big-font-mode~; use this for
  presentations or streaming.

They all accept either a font-spec, font string ("Input Mono-12"), or xlfd
font string. You generally only need these two:

IE:
#+begin_src elisp :tangle no
(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "monospace" :size 12 :weight 'semi-light)
      doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "sans" :size 13))
#+end_src

Let's choose our monospaced font, Roboto Mono goodness:
#+begin_src elisp
(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "monospace" :size 16 :name "Roboto Mono"))
#+end_src

*** Default theme

There are two ways to load a theme. Both assume the theme is installed and
available. You can either set ~doom-theme~ or manually load a theme with the
~load-theme~ function. This is the default:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq doom-theme 'doom-nord)
#+end_src

**** Nord powered aesthetics.

Let's add some small customizations, mostly make everything a bit brighter and bigger:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package! doom-nord-theme
  :defer t
  :custom
  (doom-nord-brighter-modeline t)
  (doom-nord-padded-modeline t)
  (doom-nord-region-highlight 'frost))
#+end_src

*** Rainbow Delimeters

Matching pairs draw with the same face color, making them easily identifiable.

#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook! 'prog-mode-hook #'rainbow-delimiters-mode-enable)
#+end_src

*** Modeline

The default doom-modeline is great, the only thing is that I want it to show me
the evil state I am in with a letter instead of an icon:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package! doom-modeline
  :defer t
  :custom
  (doom-modeline-modal-icon nil))
#+end_src

Also, the battery indicator is pretty neat:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package! battery
  :hook
  (doom-modeline-mode . display-battery-mode))
#+end_src

*** TODO Perspective

*** Org

One of the killer features of emacs.

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package! org
    :defer t
#+end_src

If you use ~org~ and don't want your org files in the default location below,
change ~org-directory~. It must be set before org loads!

#+begin_src elisp
    :custom
    (org-directory "~/Cloud/org/")
#+end_src

Set ~org-attach-id-dir~ back to default value.

#+begin_src elisp
    (org-attach-id-dir  "data")
#+end_src

I only use one agenda file, that has all my rutine stuff in it.

#+begin_src elisp
    (org-agenda-files  `(,(expand-file-name "agenda.org" org-directory)))
#+end_src

Modules for keeping track of habits and completing checklists.

#+begin_src elisp
    (org-module  '(org-habit org-checklist))
#+end_src

Switch entry to 'DONE' when all subentries are done else keep entry original todo state.

#+begin_src elisp
:config
(add-hook! 'org-after-todo-statistics-hook '(lambda (n-done n-not-done)
                                              (let (org-log-done org-log-states)
                                                (org-todo (if (= n-not-done 0)
                                                              "DONE"
                                                            (pcase (org-get-todo-state) ;; Keeps the keyword state.
                                                              ('nil "")
                                                              (todo todo)))))))
#+end_src

otherwise

#+begin_src elisp
    (add-hook! 'org-checkbox-statistics-hook  '(lambda ()
                                             (let ((todo-state (org-get-todo-state)) beg end)
                                               (unless (not todo-state)

*** Pretending we are in vim? That's just plain EVIL!

Bad puns aside, vim keybindings are hard to let go once you are used to them.
Luckily, doom comes with much of the heavy lifting already done when it comes to
evil mode. We just gotta customize some minor details.

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package! evil
  :defer t
  :custom
#+end_src

Make horizontal motions move to other lines.

#+begin_src elisp
  (evil-cross-lines t)
#+end_src

Remove highlighted items after search is finished.

#+begin_src elisp
  (evil-ex-search-persistent-highlight nil)
#+end_src

Universal argument mapped to M-u instead.

#+begin_src elisp
  :config
  (map! :g "M-u" #'universal-argument
#+end_src

Remove highlighted items after a search.

#+begin_src elisp
        :m "C-l" #'evil-ex-nohighlight))
#+end_src

*** Line-numbers

This determines the style of line numbers in effect. If set to ~nil~, line
numbers are disabled. For relative line numbers, set this to ~relative~.

#+begin_src elisp
(setq display-line-numbers-type 'relative)
#+end_src

*** Helpful

Let's make an global keybinding to find something I don't understand about emacs
quickly!

#+begin_src elisp
(map! :g "C-c C-d" #'helpful-at-point)
#+end_src

*** Which Key

Doom emacs default config is too slow, lets speed it up.

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package! which-key
  :defer t
  :custom
  (which-key-idle-delay 0.1)
  (which-key-idle-secondary-delay 0.2))
#+end_src

*** Customize Group

An essential interface to know what to customize!

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package! cus-edit
  :defer t
#+end_src

I mostly use it to know the customizable options in a package, chaging the
values within this configuration. So, let's make it show the actual real values.

#+begin_src elisp
  :custom
  (custom-unlispify-menu-entries nil)
  (custom-unlispify-tag-names nil)
  (custom-unlispify-remove-prefixes nil))
#+end_src

*** RSS, or how to get news the old-way.

First, lets bring our feeds into the cloud.

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package! elfeed
  :defer t
  :custom
  (elfeed-db-directory "~/Cloud/elfeed/")
#+end_src

Special faces for special tags.

#+begin_src elisp
  (elfeed-search-face-alist '((unread elfeed-search-unread-title-face)
                              (★      elfeed-search-unread-count-face)))
#+end_src


Show me entries from within a month that I haven't read.

#+begin_src elisp
  :config
  (setq elfeed-search-filter "@4-week-ago +unread "))
#+end_src


Give it an easy keybinding to access it:

#+begin_src elisp
(map! :leader :desc "RSS feed" :m "o e" #'elfeed)
#+end_src


And point elfeed to the org configuration file.

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package! elfeed-org
  :defer t
  :custom
  (rmh-elfeed-org-files (list (concat org-directory "elfeed.org"))))
#+end_src

Keybinding to easily find the feeds file.

#+begin_src elisp

                                          (interactive)
                                          (find-file (car rmh-elfeed-org-files))))
#+end_src

**** TODO Create =x= keybinding for =starring= (★) a register, in search map and show map

*** Japanese input.

I am learning japanese as a hobby, and I do most of my note taking in emacs. To
input japanese text we use google's MOZC.

First, let's define our toggle function. Activates mozc mode and changes the
modeline to show it.

#+begin_src elisp
;;;###autoload
(defun dan/toggle-mozc-mode ()
  "Toggle activation/deactivation of `mozc-mode'."
  (interactive)
  (let* ((active (mozc-mode))
         (msg-modeline (if active
                           '("Activated" . "日本語")
                         '("Deactivated" . ""))))
    (progn
      (message "Mozc Mode %s" (car msg-modeline))
      (setq global-mode-string (cdr msg-modeline))
#+end_src

This part is a bit of hack so mozc plays nicely with Doom's configuration of evil-org.

#+begin_src elisp
      (map! (:when (and (featurep 'evil-org) evil-org-mode) :map evil-org-mode-map
             (:when mozc-mode    :i "<return>"   nil)
             (:unless mozc-mode  :i "<return>"   (cmd! (org-return electric-indent-mode)))
             (:when mozc-mode    :i "RET"        nil)
             (:unless mozc-mode  :i "RET"        (cmd! (org-return electric-indent-mode))))))))
#+end_src

Let's lazy load mozc, so it loads only when our entry function is called.

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package! mozc
  :commands mozc-mode
#+end_src

The overlay style is sluggish, the echo-area style is pretty and very functional, it even works in the minibuffer!

#+begin_src elisp
  :custom
  (mozc-candidate-style 'echo-area))
#+end_src

Finally, we create a keybinding activate mozc-mode.

#+begin_src elisp
(map! :g "C-x j"  #'dan/toggle-mozc-mode
      :ni "C-x j" #'dan/toggle-mozc-mode)
#+end_src

**** TODO Prerequesites

*** Rust

Seems like rls is more stable than rust-analyzer.

#+begin_src elisp

** TODO Private modules.

=doom= allows the user to [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/getting_started.org#writing-your-own-modules][to write their own modules]] in their ~$DOOMDIR~

like interection and extension of ~bin/doom~, a fixed file structure where each
file is loaded at different points of the runtime and other niceties (more
~macros!~).

For now, I haven't had the need to use this feature but is good to be aware of it.
